1. Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density? Briefly explain why or why not.

No temperature isn't correlated enough with population density.

2. The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed throughout the analysis. Constantly decompressing the data seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working with the uncompressed .json data?

It takes more work to find information in the data. Since the file is compressed in size, more information is present in a denser format (less bits). It might be faster if uncompressed (although takes more bits and storage) because the information from the data is easier to collect.

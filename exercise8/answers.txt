1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why?

The KNN model does the best job. You can choose the number of training points to compare to which seems to do the best job with n = 9.


2. Have a look at the cities in your test data where the weather model makes the wrong prediction. Do you feel like the model is making reasonable mistakes? Can you think of any weather features that we could potentially add to make better predictions?

Yes it's reasonably similar weather to other cities. Perhaps more weather features might help in distinguishing these cities from one another, but none come to mind. Maybe average temperature from historic data.
